 <h3>profile</h3>
 <p>I'm a creative yet disciplined developer that gets things done. I've had plenty of experience writing iOS apps in objective C, with several of my apps currently on the app store. I'm also very familiar with Android and Java. I love experimenting with new web technologies, such as HTML5, Python/Django and jQuery. I am never really happy unless I'm learning some new programming language or making something interesting with one I already know.</p>
