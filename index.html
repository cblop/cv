 <h3>Skills and Projects</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>
         <h4>Clojure & ClojureScript development experience:</h4> 
         <ul>
             <li><p>5+ years of experience as a full-stack Clojure(Script) developer</p></li>
             <li><p>Development of APIs and tools using Clojure, Re-frame and AWS to support Cambridge English Assessment's Natural Language Processing research for English Learners</p></li>
             <li><p>Use of Clojure with Semantic Web technology (RDF and SPARQL) for the creation and querying of graph databases</p></li>
             <li><p>Creation of a constrained natural language DSL in Clojure</p></li>
             <li><p>A hybrid mobile app for Bluetooth LE beacon detection and media display using ClojureScript, Reagent and Apache Cordova.</p></li>
             <li><p>Rewriting an XMPP agent messaging service from Java to Clojure</p></li>
             <li><p>Extended Overtone (a synthesiser library) to enable use of LADSPA audio plugins</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p></p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <h4>Write and Improve, Speak and Improve</h4>
         <p>At ELiT I work on these customer-facing web applications to give English learners feedback on test English exams, both written and spoken. The system uses Cambridge English's NLP research to score and give feedback on a learner's progress. I work as a full-stack developer using Clojure (Integrant) with ClojureScript (Re-frame, reagent) and AWS infrastructure.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <h4>Speech Annotator</h4>
         <p>This is an internal ELiT tool used by a team of linguists to manually add annotations to the output of the automatic speech assessment system used in Speak and Improve. The human-produced annotations are then used to retrain the system in order to improve it. This is also a full-stack Clojure project using the same technologies as above.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <h4>Semantic Web and Graph Database Experience</h4>
         <p>This PostDoc project was to develop tools to simplify the addition of metadata to multiple large university datasets of smart home energy readings. This project used RDF and SPARQL to unify and enable querying across these multiple datasets.</p>
     </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Logic and Agent Programming experience:</h4>
        <p>EngD project uses Answer Set Programming (ASP, a logic programming paradigm) to constrain the actions of intelligent agents acting out the characters in a story. Given a author's description of a story using tropes (recurring story components), ASP code is generated and run through a solver to find the actions available to the characters at any given point in the story.</p>
    </li>
 	<li>
 		<h4>Procedural Content Generation</h4>
 		<p>MSc project was to procedurally generate 3D bridge designs by evolving and 'growing' them. Designs were then evaluated using the Bullet Physics Engine, scripted in Python.</p>
 	</li>
 	<li>
 		<h4>Web and Mobile Application Development</h4>
 		<p>Over three years of experience with developing applications for iOS (iPhone) and Android platforms, primarily using web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, ClojureScript, Coffeescript and Javascript, and also with Objective C and Java.
 	</li>
 	<li>
 		<h4>Languages</h4>
    <p><i>5+ years experience:</i> Clojure(Script)</p>
    <p><i>Also comfortable with:</i>
        Prolog, Python, Javascript, Haskell, Java, C, C++, Lua</p>
    <p><i>Dev Ops:</i> AWS, Git, Travis CI</p>
    <p><i>Spoken & written languages:</i>
 		    English (Native), Japanese (Advanced)</p>
 	</li>
  <li>
      <h4>Community Engagement</h4>
      <p>Organiser for two meetup groups in Bristol:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><h4>Bristol Clojurians</h4>
              <p>Twice-monthly meetups and occasional talks and coding events since March 2014, growing into a group with more than 100 members.</p></li>
          <li><h4>Bristol Japanese Language Meetup</h4>
              <p>Started in November 2013 with weekly Japanese conversation practice, as well as monthly events such as dinners and karaoke. This group has over 300 members, with 20 - 30 coming to the weekly events.</p></li>
