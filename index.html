 <h3>Profile</h3>
 <p>I'm a graduate EngD student with the Centre for Digital Entertainment at the University of Bath, UK. Working together with Sysemia Ltd, my research focuses on using Semantic Web technologies to design interactive experiences. There's a lot more to me than my interest in computers, though! I've volunteered and worked in many different countries around the world, interacting with many different people and cultures. My dream is to someday do something that combines these two passions.</p>
